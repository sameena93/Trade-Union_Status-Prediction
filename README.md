#  Trade Union Status Prediction for Data Scientists

---

<p>The objective of this project is to analyze training data and predict the trade union membership status of Data Scientists. The target variable, "LeftUnion," indicates whether a member is still part of the union (LeftUnion_No) or has left the union (LeftUnion_Yes).</p>

<p>By building a predictive model, the project aims to understand factors influencing union membership and provide valuable insights into trends and behaviors related to union affiliation among data scientists.</p>
