# Trade Union Status Prediction for Data Scientists

---

The objective of this project is to analyze training data and predict the trade union membership status of Data Scientists. The target variable, **"LeftUnion"**, indicates whether a member is still part of the union (*LeftUnion_No*) or has left the union (*LeftUnion_Yes*).

By building a predictive model, the project aims to understand factors influencing union membership and provide valuable insights into trends and behaviors related to union affiliation among data scientists.

## Data Analysis and Visualizations

Various analyses and visualizations were conducted during the project. Below are the key plots and their descriptions:

1. **Boxplot:** Distribution of Total Dues, Monthly Dues, and Months in Union.

2. **Correlation Matrix:** Heatmap showing correlations among key variables.

## Modeling and Results

Several machine learning models were implemented to predict the "LeftUnion" status:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The **accuracy comparison** of these models was visualized and included in the project.
