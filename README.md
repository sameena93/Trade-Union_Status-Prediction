#  Trade Union Status Prediction for Data Scientists

---

<p>The objective of this project is to analyze training data and predict the trade union membership status of Data Scientists. The target variable, "LeftUnion," indicates whether a member is still part of the union (LeftUnion_No) or has left the union (LeftUnion_Yes).</p>

<p>By building a predictive model, the project aims to understand factors influencing union membership and provide valuable insights into trends and behaviors related to union affiliation among data scientists.</p>

    </ol>

    <h2>Modeling and Results</h2>
    <p>Several machine learning models were implemented to predict the "LeftUnion" status:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Logistic Regression</li>
        <li>Decision Tree</li>
        <li>Random Forest</li>
        <li>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <strong>accuracy comparison</strong> of these models was visualized and included in the project.</p>
